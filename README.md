# NNFS - neural network library from scratch

This project aim is getting better understanding of how NNs work inside. I plan to add 
here as many features as I can, and don't care too much about optimization.

## Current TODOs:
 
 - Add more optimizers(currently there is only hard-coded gradient descent) 
 - Add more layers(now only dense layer and activations)
 - Add callbacks
 - Make non-sequential architectures available?(I have no idea how to implement it, 
 this will require writing some graph-related stuff, which I am not good at)
